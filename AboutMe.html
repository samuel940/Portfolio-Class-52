My favorite food is pizza. I like coding and playing games with my friends. I watch a lot of anime. I play D&D with my friends.
I started coding because it was something that intrested me and my mom wanted me to do something over summer break. It is really 
interesting. I thankful for my parents for giving me this opportunity. I have gotten preety good at coding so far even though it has been difficult.
